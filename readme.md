## üèó Adding a Feature

In order to add a togglable feature to the extension you'll need to update the files listed below. This guide assumes you've added a new `<feature>.js` file to `js/extension/features/` and that it does not require additional CSS files, configuration pages, or submenus. Features that require their own configuration pages or submenus are more complex and are out of scope for this guide.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ background.js

- Add a new property to the `prefs` object of `background.js`. It should be a `boolean` and have a unique name that easily identifies the feature. Make sure to add the property in the correct alphabetical position.

- Add a conditional check for the new `prefs` property under the `User Preferences` comment block. This should check the preference and create a DOM element that contains the necessary script files for the new feature.

> Example:

```javascript
  if ( result.prefs.featureName ) {

    let featureName = document.createElement('script');

    featureName.type = 'text/javascript';
    featureName.src = chrome.extension.getURL('js/extension/features/feature-name.js');
    featureName.className = 'de-init';

    elems.push(featureName);
  }
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ popup.html

- Modify `popup.html` with the new preference menu option. Update the markup with a unique `id`, help-bubble text, and meta keywords. Make sure to add the markup in the correct alphabetical position.

> Example:

```html
    <!-- title of the new feature -->
    <div class="toggle-group">
      <p class="label">title of the new feature</p>
      <div class="meta hide">Keywords that represent the feature go here. These are used as metadata when searching.</div>

      <div class="onoffswitch">
        <input type="checkbox" name="onoffswitch" class="onoffswitch-checkbox" id="toggleNewFeatureName" checked>
        <label class="onoffswitch-label" for="toggleNewFeatureName">
          <span class="onoffswitch-inner"></span>
          <span class="onoffswitch-switch"></span>
        </label>
      </div>

      <div class="help feature-name">
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-help-circle" color="#384047"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M9.09 9a3 3 0 0 1 5.83 1c0 2-3 3-3 3"></path><line x1="12" y1="17" x2="12" y2="17"></line></svg>
        <div class="help-bubble">
          <div class="help-text">
            A short description of the new feature goes here.
          </div>
          <div class="arrow-right stroke"></div><div class="arrow-right"></div>
        </div>
      </div> <!-- /.help -->
    </div>
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ manifest.json and webpack.config.js

- Modify `manifest.json` and `webpack.config.js` with the paths to the new feature files.

> Example:

`manifest.json`

```JSON
  "js/extension/features/feature-name.js",
```

`webpack.config.js`

```javascript
  [features + 'feature-name']: `${features}feature-name.js`,
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ utils.js

- Update the `applySave` method in `utils.js` with the same property name used in `background.js`. Be sure to reference the `id` set in the `popup.html` markup and add the property in the correct alphabetical position.

> Example:

```javascript
export function applySave(message, event) {

  let prefs = {
    ...
    featureName: document.getElementById('toggleFeatureName').checked,
    ...
  }
}
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ popup.js

Make the following changes to `popup.js`:
- Update the `load` eventListener  with the new property.
- Add a new `change` eventListener under the `Event listeners for toggles` comment block.
- Update the `chrome.storage.sync.get` callback with the new property.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ learn.html

Add the feature description to `learn.html`. Make sure to insert the new markup block in the correct alphabetical order.

> Example:

```HTML
    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Feature Name -->
      <h2 id="featureName">Feature Name</h2>

      <p>Supporting text describing how the feature works.</p>
      <!-- supporting image(s) if needed -->
      <img src="../img/learn/feature-image.png" class="max-width" />
    </div>
```

### üì¶ Build The Extension

Since changes have been made to `webpack`, the extension will need to be rebuilt by running `npm run build`. Once the build is finished, load the extension in Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions`. Make sure `Developer Mode` is checked, then click 'Load unpacked' and choose the newly exported `dist` folder. You should now be able to enable the feature from the popup menu.
